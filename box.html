   <h1>Robot</h1>
   A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of
   carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.[2] Robots can be guided
   by an external control device or the control may be embedded within. Robots
   may be constructed on the lines of human form, but most robots are machines
   designed to perform a task with no regard to their aesthetics.
