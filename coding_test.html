  <p><strong>Computer programming</strong> is the process of designing and building an executable
     computer program to accomplish a specific computing result. Programming
     involves tasks such as; analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms'
      accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms
      in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2]
       The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that
        are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is
        directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of
        programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate
        the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating
        system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process
        of programming thus often requires expertise in several different
        subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized
        algorithms, and formal logic.</p>
